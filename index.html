                <p class="about1">
                    My name is Brandon Hughes and I’m currently a senior at Chapman University with a major in computer
                    science, while also working part time as an Office Assistant for the First Aid department at Knott’s
                    Berry Farm. Through my school, I learned a lot of technical skills and want to expand my knowledge
                    about more technologies to apply into my job. While through my job, I learned more soft
                    skills, such as organization and collaboration.

                <p class="project1">
                    The program is a simulation-based application designed to calculate the number of turns required
                    to
                    complete a game on a board with dimensions n x n and a specified number of levels (l). It likely
                    simulates gameplay scenarios to determine the average or expected number of turns
                    needed to finish the game. The game seems to involve navigating through levels represented by
                    squares on the board, and the simulation would provide insights into the efficiency or
                    difficulty of
                    completing the game based on various factors such as board size and level complexity.

                <p class="project1">
                    The project involved creating a Scapegoat Binary Search Tree (BST) database for university students
                    and faculty. This self-balancing tree structure ensures efficient data management, maintaining
                    logarithmic height for optimal performance. The database serves as a central repository for academic
                    information, including student records and faculty profiles. Its functionalities include adding,
                    updating, and querying records, addressing the diverse data management needs of university
                    environments efficiently.
